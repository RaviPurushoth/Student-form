# Student-form
A simple and responsive student registration form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to enter student details and saves the data locally on the device using localStorage.

🚀 Features

✅ JavaScript-based input validation

💾 Stores student data in localStorage (no backend required)

🔁 Ability to reset form and clear stored data

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML – Form structure

CSS – Styling and layout

JavaScript – Form validation and data storage using localStorage

📦 How It Works
The user fills out the form.

On submission, the data is validated and then stored in the browser's localStorage.

The data persists even after the page is refreshed, until the user clears it.

🔒 Note
This project does not require a backend or database.

Data is stored only on the user's device and not shared or uploaded online.

You can enhance it by displaying the saved data in a table or allowing edits.
